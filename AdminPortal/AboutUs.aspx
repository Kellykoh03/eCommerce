        <p >
            It all began with the Electrox Retailing Concept initiated by our Managing Director, Mr Ali and Chairman, Mr Abu. With both veterans in IT Retail industry for more than 20 years prior to setting up Electrox, their business know-how has made invaluable contributions to the growth of our company.

On Nov 1,2003, together with the Grand Opening of our 1st outlet, Electrox made a ground breaking news for being recognized as “The Largest Computer Retail Outlet” by Msia Book of Record. Aspiring to be No 1 in all areas of IT Retailing; not just to remain as a fading pioneer, we constantly reinvent new ideas to add values to our product ranges and services, from launching membership loyalty program (Electrox Rewards) to e-commerce. We have certainly turned on the competitive fever among our rivals and the dynamic landscape in IT industry has never been the same again since our arrival.
